## Exercise 2

### Item (a)

Yes, since rule a(A,2) establishes that fact as true for any symbol replacing A, so a(X,2) is true for any X.

### Item (b)

X=2, since b(2, B) establishes that fact as true for any symbol replacing B; thus, by replacing B with kalamazoo we have that X=2 is the first answer.

### Item (c)

c(X, b3) is deductible from a(X, N), b(N, b3). a(a1,1) satisfies a(X,N) and b(N, b3) is a fact, thus the first answer is X=a1, where N=1.

### Item (d)

c(X, Y) is deductible from a(X, N), b(N, Y). a(a1, 1) satisfies a(X, N) with (X, N) = (a1, 1), and b(1, b1) satisfies b(N, Y) with (N, Y) = (1, b1), thus the first solution is (X, Y) = (a1, b1), where N=1.

### Item (e)

d(X, Y) is deductible from a(X,N), b(Y,N). a(a1, 1) satisfies a(X,N) with (X,N)=(a1,1), and b(2,B) satisfies b(Y,N) with Y=2 and B being any value. As such, the first answer is (X, Y) = (a1, 2) with N=B=1.
